# Vue.Js Playground

Here you will find the two ways to create a vue.js project.

## The CDN Way

The CDN way, you should add the `vue.js` cdn in your HTML file, and call it in your `js` file, using
the create method.

## The CLI Way

The CLI way, you should install globally `vue.js` in your local, then run `vue create [project_name]`, and setup your project.
You can also run `vue ui`, and create your project using the GUI.
